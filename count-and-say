The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
1 is read off as one 1 or 11.
11 is read off as two 1s or 21.

21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.

Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

Example:

if n = 2,
the sequence is 11
